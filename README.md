# Milfoil Data Visualization

A project to illustrate the growth and retreat of the Eurasian Watermilfoil in Cazenovia Lake, resulting from treatment with herbicide that specifically targets this invasive plant.

My intent is to use Plotly's animation features to show circles representing Milfoil growing and shrinking on a map of the lake. The circles will correlate to the density of the Milfoil from the annual "Rake Toss" aquatic plant survey conducted on the lake. The visualization will include the year and information about whether the lake was treated that year, and details about the treatment if it was.

This project is also an initial venture into working with the data collected on the many aquatic plant species present in the lake in the annual Rake Toss. My intent is to eventually integrate the Rake Toss data into a database with data from all the studies conducted on Cazenovia Lake in recent years.
