# Milfoil Data Visualization

A project to illustrate the growth and retreat of the Eurasian Watermilfoil in Cazenovia Lake, resulting from treatment with herbicide that specifically targets this invasive plant.

The final result complete with titles to annotate the year and treatment information is now available [as a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Xel6vyh29CY)

My intent was to use Plotly's animation features to show circles representing Milfoil growing and shrinking on a map of the lake. The circles correlate to the density of the Milfoil from the annual "Rake Toss" aquatic plant survey conducted on the lake. The final visualization includes the year and information about whether the lake was treated that year, and details about the treatment if it was.

This project was also an initial venture into working with the data collected on the many aquatic plant species present in the lake in the annual Rake Toss. Before being able to work with it, I [extracted the data from multiple excel files and cleaned it](https://github.com/kgilbert78/rake-toss-data-cleaning).  My intent is to eventually integrate the Rake Toss data into a database with data from all the studies conducted on Cazenovia Lake in recent years.
